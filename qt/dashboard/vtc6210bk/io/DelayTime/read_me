You need to insert the "NEXCOM_IO" driver when you want to use Delay ON/OFF function.
The driver provide two API on Delay_IO.h for setting Delay ON/OFF function after you open this device driver.Two API describption is as below.
1. DelayON_Set(char) :
	The "char" parameter is a character to set time of Delay ON. 
	The definition of "char" value is as below.
	   	(0) Set time of Delay ON to 0 sec
        	(1) Set time of Delay ON to 10 sec        	
		(2) Set time of Delay ON to 30 sec
        	(3) Set time of Delay ON to 1 min
        	(4) Set time of Delay ON to 5 min
        	(5) Set time of Delay ON to 10 min
        	(6) Set time of Delay ON to 15 min
        	(7) Set time of Delay ON to 30 min
        	(8) Set time of Delay ON to 1 hour

	
2. DelayOFF_Set(char) :
 	The "char" parameter is a character to set time of Delay OFF. 
	The definition of "char" value is as below.
	   	(0) Set time of Delay ON to 0 sec
        	(1) Set time of Delay ON to 20 sec        	
		(2) Set time of Delay ON to 1 min
        	(3) Set time of Delay ON to 5 min
        	(4) Set time of Delay ON to 10 min
        	(5) Set time of Delay ON to 30 min
        	(6) Set time of Delay ON to 1 hour
        	(7) Set time of Delay ON to 6 hour
        	(8) Set time of Delay ON to 18 hour

3. You can use "gcc" to compile two demo program.
	3.1) gcc demo_DelayON.c Delay_Set.c -o demo_DelayON
	3.2) gcc demo_DelayOFF.c Delay_Set.c -o demo_DelayOFF

PS: please make sure you have "root"authority when you execute demo program.
