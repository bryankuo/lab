The Linux Parallel Port Programming HOWTO

可否先用bash測試port呢?

For a kernel driver, the parallel port is accessed by calling on the kernel's parport functions.
For a user-space program there are two options: use Tim Waugh's PPDEV generic parallel port driver via ioctl functions, or use direct low level port IO through the inb/outb family of macros provided with the GNU C library
