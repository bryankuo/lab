Start with: apt-get install nfs-kernel-server
/etc/init.d/nfs-kernel-server restart
warning does not support nfs export
Have you tried renaming the folder to have an underscore and export that?
switched to ext4 and I'm getting this error. Any ideas?
i thought maybe /etc/hosts.allow was the issue, at first, but   nfsd: ALL  does nothing.
mount -l

NEWS.Debian.gz 裡有提到的 
* Exports default to "sync", that is, synchronous writes. 
This is safer but MUCH SLOWER than the old default of "async". 
All exports should be marked as either "sync" or "async" to 
avoid a warning from exportfs. 
/ubuntu  *(ro,sync,no_root_squash)
/home    *(rw,sync,no_root_squash)

google exportfs: /etc/exports [1]: Neither 'subtree_check' or 'no_subtree_check" specified for export "*:/aaa"

The Ubuntu kernel unfortunately doesn't support NFS exports of FUSE based file systems.

Please consider the sshfs system, from the FUSE project.
NFS and Samba are old and busted.
